	<h1>abstraction</h1>
<p> Data abstraction is one of the m essential and important feature of object
                    oriented programming in C++. Abstraction
                    means displaying only essential information
                    and hiding the details. Data abstraction
                    refers to providing only essential information
                    about the data to the outside world,
                    hiding the background details or implementation.

                    <br> 
                    Consider a real life example of a man driving
                    a car. The man only knows that pressing the
                    accelerators will increase the speed of car
                    or applying brakes will stop the car but he
                    does not know about how on pressing accelerator
                    the speed is actually increasing, he does
                    not know about the inner mechanism of the car
                    or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
                    etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
                </p>
                <p><b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can
                    implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.
                    Class helps us to group data members and member
                    functions using available access specifiers. A
                    Class can decide which data member will be
                    visible to outside
                    world and which is not.
                    <br>
                    <b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One
                    more type of abstraction in C++ can be
                    header files. For example, consider the
                    pow() method present in math.h header file.
                    Whenever we need to calculate power of a
                    number, we simply call the
                    function pow() present in the math.h header
                    file and pass the numbers as arguments
                    without knowing the underlying algorithm
                    according to which the function is actually
                    calculating power of numbers.
                    <h2>Advantages of Data Abstraction</h2>
 
                    </b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing
                    the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code
                    duplication and increases reusability.<br>
                    3. Can change internal implementation of
                    class independently without
                    affecting the user.<br> 4. Helps to
                    increase security of an application or program
                    as only important details are
                    provided to the user.</p>
