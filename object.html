          Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name
                    suggests uses objects in programming.
                    Object-oriented programming aims to
                    implement real-world entities like
                    inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
                    etc in programming. The main
                    aim of OOP is to bind together the data
                    and the functions that operate on them
                    so that no other part of the code can
                    access this data except that function.
                </p>
               
                    An Object is an identifiable
                    entity with some characteristics and behavior.
                    An Object is an instance of a Class. When a
                    class is defined, no memory is allocated but
                    when it is instantiated (i.e. an
                    object is created) memory is allocated.
                    <br>
                    <b>Class</b>
                   <p> The building block of C++ that
                    leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
                    It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
                    own data members and member functions, which can
                    be accessed & used by creating an instance
                    of that class. A class is like a blueprint for
                    an object. For Example: Consider the Class
                    of Cars. There may be many cars with different
                    names and brand but all of them will share
                    some common properties like all of them will
                    have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.
                    So here, Car is the class and wheels,
                    speed limits, mileage are their properties.</p>
