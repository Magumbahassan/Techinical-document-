    <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
  <p>
                    In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
                    as wrapping up of data and information
                    under a single unit. In Object Oriented
                    Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
                    binding together the data and the functions
                    that manipulates them. Consider
                    a real life example
                    of encapsulation, in a company there are
                    different sections like the accounts section,
                    finance section, sales section etc. The finance
                    section handles all the financial transactions
                    and keep records of all the data related to
                    finance.
                    Similarly the sales section handles all the
                    sales related activities and keep records of
                    all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                    when for some reason an official from finance
                    section needs all the data about sales in a
                    particular
                    month. In this case, he is not allowed to
                    directly access the data of sales section.
                    He will first have to contact some other
                    officer in the sales section and then
                    request him to
                    give the particular data. This is what
                    encapsulation is. Here the data of
                    sales section and the
                    employees that can manipulate them are
                    wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
                </p>
 
                <p>
                    Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
                    or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
                    the data. In the above example the data of
                    any of the section like sales, finance or
                    accounts is hidden from any other section.
                    <br>
                    In C++ encapsulation
                    can be implemented using Class
                    and access modifiers.
