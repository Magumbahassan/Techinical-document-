	<h1> polymorphism    </h1>
	<p>
                    The word polymorphism means having many
                    forms. In simple words, we can define
                    polymorphism as the ability of a message
                    to be displayed in more than one form.
                    A real-life example of polymorphism, a
                    person at the same time can have
                    different characteristics.
                    Like a man at the same time is a father,
                    a husband, an employee. So the same
                    person posses different behavior in
                    different situations. This is called
                    polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
                    as one of the important features of Object
                    Oriented Programming.

                    <b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly
                        divided into two types:</b>
                    <br>

                    <li>Compile time Polymorphism</li>
                   
<li>Runtime Polymorphism</li> <br>
    <p> Compile time polymorphism: This type of
                    polymorphism is achieved by function
                    overloading or operator overloading.
                    <br> Runtime polymorphism: This type
                    of polymorphism is achieved by
                    Function Overriding.
